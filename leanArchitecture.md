# Lean Architecture

### Applying some of the Lean Architecture techniques on the modules/packages identified in your architecture, identify the components/entities  (classes for example) of said modules, while trying to keep your architecture flexible. Explain your logic by referring to some of the techniques reviewed in class.

## Classes
- User Class
- Tour Class
- Leg Class

With this simple application, I think it's fairly easy to have the components of the project partioned. There needs to be a user class to be able to login to the site, and so that Tours and Legs of Tours can be linked to the User.
